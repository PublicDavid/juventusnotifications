# Juventus Fixture Notifications
## _Follow fixtures via Discord Notifications_
 
 ✨ This project is written with the help of AI✨ 
 
 I wanted a way to get notifications about upcoming matches of Juventus and the final score after a game

## Features

- Based on an team ID the script looks for the first upcoming match of a team
- Every 20 minutes the Action runs and checks if the game is finished

## Whats in the .env file

- A webhook of the Discord Channel
