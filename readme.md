# Juventus Fixture Notifications
## _Follow fixtures via Discord Notifications_
 
 ✨ This project is written with the help of AI✨ 
 
 I wanted a way to get notifications about upcoming matches of Juventus and the final score after a game

## Features

- Based on an team ID the script looks for the first upcoming match of a team
- 130 minutes after a game has started the script tries to get the final score, if the score is not known yet it waits 15 minutes and so on

## Whats in the .env file

- A webhook of the Discord Channel
